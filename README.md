Dear reader,

I decided to create this repository when my account on the Omeka Classic forum was deleted during the review process of the installation notes included in this repository. 
I had already noted that communication was not the forte of the Omeka.net support team (the paying platform), but the above was the last straw. 

I make no representation for the fitness of the included instructions for your specific use case.
However, based on the questions found on this rather uninformative forum, I trust they can help people out there, and somewat improve the dearth of documentation on the Omeka classic platform. 

Therefore you will find here, some installation instructions and other tricks related to installing, feeding, and maintaining Omeka classic instances on Unix platforms.

Cheers
